# drone-gke

Deploy images to Kubernetes on Google Container Engine. This is a little simpler
than deploying straight to Kube, because the api endpoints and credentials and
whatnot can be derived using the Google credentials.

This is currently very new and unstable.  
Please don't use it for anything important!
